# fallingParticles
This is a particle simulation. The original version (indexOG.html) only has particles falling down. The updated version (indexMain.html) has a slider to control how the particles move. It also has a slider to contol the number of particles.
The six modes are:
1. linear down
2. linear up
3. linear right
4. linear left
5. radial in
6. radial out
7. spiral in right
8. spiral in left
9. spiral out right.
10. spiral out left.

The URL can be used to change the default mode. The default image is Van Gogh's "*Starry night*"  
You can change the image by changing the url on line 73. Just note that not all images are supported due to Cross Origin Resource Policy. I find that images from wikimedia/wikipedia usualy work.   
If the animation is slow, you can try editing the number of particles on line 144. Above it is a small guide as to what you may want to set it to. You can also see it below:
